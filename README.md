# Facebook-recruit-Humans-or-bots

This is my solution for the Kaggle's competition [Facebook recruit: Humans or bots](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot). The goal is with all the data of bids made on an online auction platform, we try to identify if the bidder is human or robot. To achieve this goal, we carry out many steps of feature extraction and applied the XGBoost algorithm on the refined training data. 
For more detailed of the work, please see [my notebook](https://github.com/dmnguyen92/Facebook-recruit-Humans-or-bots/blob/master/Facebook:%20Human%20or%20Bots.ipynb)
